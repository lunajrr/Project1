        <h1>The JuanBank Family</h1>
        <h2>Owner: Juan Luna</h2>
        <p>Born in a small town, he understands hard work. A man that put the effort to learn and master new technologies in the new<br>
        field that puts people that need help ahead. He promises that he will do everything he can to help people that are less fortunate.<br>
    He believes that everybody deserves a second change and is willing to put everything he has on the line to prove it.</p>
    <h1>What has he done for Covid-19?</h1>
    <h2>He has done more than anybody</h2>
    <p>By firing all staff and ensuring he is the only one in the bank; he has ensure that no-one has contracted the Covid-19 while<br>
    working for him. With the lack of employees, he hasn't had to waste money on Covid-19 precautions, just like the big companies.<br>
    Juan and his shady bank practices allow him to compete with big corporations for the little man. Feel free to make a donation to<br>
     Juan's totally non-profit organization to fight for the struggling and little man.</p>
     <h1>Shady-Practices Allegations</h1>
     <h2>Allegations are just that. Allegations.</h2>
     <p>He has done more than anybody to provide necessary bank operations to the low-income. While many other banks will not take a risk<br>
    on them; Juan has done everything from providing accounts to free invest/retirement Consultations, mortgages, loans, and many more.<br>
    It is no wonder that he has been accused of not following the guide lines or cutting the "rules" to provide his services. To those accusations<br>
    he says, "People will look for reasons why they will benefit others. In America, we should take care of our own; not look down on them."</p>

        <h2>Juan's Totally's Non-Profit Organization </h2>
        <p>Is Juan's Totally's Non-Profit Organization an actual non-profit organization? Just like many other non-profits It depends<br>
        it depends on who you ask. Do you think we help people by providing Juan his 500k salary to be CEO of the non-profit? If so, then<br>
        It is a non-profit. A simple 500k salary will allow him to maintain his mansion and 20 cars. Without that, he would be like a stuggling<br>
        pleb with only 10 cars and a three story house. This non-profit allows him to not worry about his income when owning a bank and using it<br>
        to add more to his income.</p>
    <h1>Is this an actual bank?</h1>
    <p>It is not an actual bank. The profits of this bank goes towards Juan and only him. This profit allows him to maintain his life style with<br>
    with shady pratices such as 15% compound interest rates on simple loans and worst interest on other loans. He provides a 0% interest rate with<br>
    with his checking and saving's accounts! This is the only way that he could provide his services to the low-income and terrible credit people.</p>
     <h1>So why use this bank?</h1>
     <h2>Why not?</h2>
